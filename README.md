# SPASE
SPASE metadata resource descriptions with ESA naming authority




## SPASE
The Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) consortium is an international community establishing standards and services to enable the open exchange of Heliophysics data (https://spase-group.org/index.html). SPASE administers the metadata registry available on the Heliophysics Data Environment (HPDE) GitHub (https://github.com/hpde) of all agencies Heliophysics missions.

## HPA SPASE repository
This repository contains datasets and missions metadata descriptions from ESA led missions.

## Link to HPDE GitHub
SPASE descriptions of ESA led missions will be mirrored at the HPDE GitHub. The mirroring process is coordinated between ESA and the SPASE Metadata Working Group (SMWG) and will occur on a regular basis.

## How to suggest changes
Changes to our SPASE descriptions are possible and can be requested via email: ESDC-HPA@cosmos.esa.int. To request a change please use [ChangeRequest SPASE] tag + file name in the email title.
